    <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
       elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>

    <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
       do not.</p>

<!-- content, padding, border, margin

        1.The padding of a box has a background, while margins are always transparent.
        2.Padding is included in the click area of an element, while margins aren’t.
        3.Margins collapse vertically, while padding doesn’t (we’ll discuss this more in the next section).

        Both <div> and <span> are “container” elements that don’t have any affect on the semantic structure of an HTML document.

        The width and height properties only define the size of a box’s content. Its padding and border are both added on top of whatever explicit dimensions you set
          box-sizing: border-box; 
          
        There are three methods for horizontally aligning block-level elements: “auto-margins” for center alignment, “floats” for left/right alignment, and “flexbox” for complete control over alignment.
